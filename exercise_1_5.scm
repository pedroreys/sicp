(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y)
    (if (= x 0)
        0
        y))

the p procedure is an infinite recursion as it simply evaluates itself.

the test procedure will return 0 if the first argument is 0 or will return the second argument if the first one is different than 0.

if the expression (test 0 (p)) is evaluated in a interpreter that uses Applicative-Order evaluation, the interpreter will get stuck in an infinite loop, as it will try to evaluate all arguments first, before applying the
"test" procedure to them. So, the (p) argument will be evaluated thus the infinite recursion. If the expression is evaluated by an interpreter that uses Normal-Oder execution, it will simply return 0, as the second argument (p) won't be evaluated,
given that the "else" branch will never be evaluated.
